- Mark the story as done in the markdown file

## User Story 6: Complete session creation form and flow

**Goal:** Complete the session creation UI with proper form handling and API integration

**Status:** Completed

**Completed Tasks:**
✅ `/create` page exists with authentication flow
✅ Authentication requirement implemented via middleware
✅ Basic UI layout and styling
✅ User profile display and sign-out functionality
✅ 1. Connect form to session creation API (`POST /api/sessions`)
✅ 2. Add client-side form validation matching server-side rules
✅ 3. Implement loading states and success/error handling
✅ 4. Add proper error messaging for API failures
✅ 5. Display session details and success state after creation
✅ 6. Form reset and "create another" functionality

**Implementation Details:**

You are a software developer working on a Q&A application. Your task is to implement a single story from a list of stories. Only implement a single story.

A list of stories to work on:
<stories>
$ARGUMENT
</stories>

Now, follow these steps to complete your task and think about it:

1. Read through the list of stories in the file.
2. Identify the first story that is not marked as complete or finished.
3. Perform that story

When implementing the story, keep in mind the functional spec for the application: @PRODUCT_SPEC.md
When writing the code keep in mind the technical guidelines: @TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

Make sure to:
- Follow the existing code conventions and patterns in the project
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the database schema defined in the technical specification
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Test your implementation if possible
- Update the story status to "Completed" when finished
